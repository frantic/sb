## Introduction

Use [`sb`](http://mrkane27.github.io/sb/sb.htm?q=list) as a search engine in your browser, and you can type things like
`gi boat` to search for pictures of boats, `yt rickroll` to search for videos,
etc.

You can add your own aliases, for example `alias bing http://www.bing.com/search?q=%s'.

Use `list` to see what commands are available.

## Installation
